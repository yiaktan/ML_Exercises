## Project Summary
This is an exercise in Naïve Bayes classification and basic natural language processing concepts. I use the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset and process critic reviews into word vectors. Then, I use Naïve Bayes classification to predict whether a movie is "fresh" or not based on critic reviews.
