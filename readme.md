## Project Summary
In this project I explore the linear regression tools in SciKit Learn and Statsmodels on the Boston housing dataset.
I analyze residual, QQ, and leverage plots to determine how well the dataset fits the assumptions for linearity, and identify outliers based on residuals and leverage plots to improve the overall model.
