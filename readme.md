## 1. Boston Housing (Linear Regression) Project Summary
In this project I explore the linear regression tools in SciKit Learn and Statsmodels on the Boston housing dataset.
I analyze residual, QQ, and leverage plots to determine how well the dataset fits the assumptions for linearity, and identify outliers based on residuals and leverage plots to improve the overall model.

## 2. Heights/Weights & Gender (Logistic Regression)
This IPython Notebook provides a breakdown of how machine learning concepts like cross validation, GridSearch, and Logistic Regression work (Using the SciKit Learn Package). All work is done using a dataset of heights, weights, and gender to provide a straightforward introduction to logistic regression.
